This project is about data analysis of endangered species.

For this project, I acted as a data analyst for the National Park Service. I helped them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.

I performed some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigated if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I analyze, clean up, and plotted data, posed questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After analysis, I created a presentation to share my findings with the National Park Service.
